# My solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges

All solutions are written in C since I'm practicing it.
Every solution has 2 functions in it that solve the 2 parts of the challenge. Sometimes some of the code is re-used in the second part, since each part represents a standalone solution.

## Running the scripts
After compiling the C code, run:
```<executable> (1|2) <input_file_path>```

The second argument states which part of the puzzle you'd like to be solved.

**Note**: The solutions may not be optimized. I am trying though!.
